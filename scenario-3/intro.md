You've created your first application and it works perfectly when deployed locally. 
Your app has two endpoints `/started` and `/healthz`. When you run locally, `/started` tells you when the application started and `/healthz` returns ok.

Satisfied that your application works as expected, its now time to deploy to Kubernetes, only, things don't go according to plan....
